      <description>I use reflector to keep my pacman mirrors ordered by speed from me. However, when the mirrorlist is updated by pacman -Syu, I had do a sequence of commands to reflectorise it.
To automate it, add the following file: ./etc/pacman.d/hooks/mirrorupgrade.hook [Trigger] Operation =Upgrade Type =Package Target =pacman-mirrorlist [Action] Description =Updating pacman-mirrorlist with reflector and removing pacnew... When =PostTransaction Depends =reflector Exec =/usr/bin/bash -c &amp;#34;reflector --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist &amp;amp;&amp;amp; [[ -f /etc/pacman.</description>

      <description>A nasty surprise in the latest openvpn@.service definitions on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) - OpenVPN can start before networking and so dhcp will complain about an unknown interface tun0 and the whole network stack does not get started.
The solution is to add After=networking.service to the [Unit] section of the file /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@.service
source: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn/+bug/1598522
on google cloud, the only way to fix this problem (short of having proper serial port login access configured) is to delete instance/detach the disk, attach to another vm, fix this file and recreate instance using the same disk as described in this answer@ StackOverflow</description>
